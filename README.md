# WEBPACK Basics

This is a very very very basic introduction to using Webpack.  Here you can learn what is Webpack for, why is it convenient to use it and how you configure it to start using it with your projects.

## What is Webpack for?

According to the [official site](https://webpack.js.org/), Webpack bundles your scripts, styles, images and assets into more organized and compacted files.

My own definition of Webpack, which comes more from the use I give to webpack would be like: Webpack is a tool that let's you automate your dev processes and organizes your files into fewer files without breaking dependencies.

An example of what Webpack is for would be converting your sass styles into css files and then bundling them up into a single css file.
Another example could be transpiling your flashy ECMA6 code into more browser friendly javascript.

## Why is it convenient to use Webpack?

Trust me, you don't want to do all the dev processes yourself.  Converting sass files into css files, es6 into es5, concatenating files, optimizing images, etc.  If you want to do it, that's ok, but for me that's really tedious work that to be honest, don't know how to do.  So I like tools that allow me to add a configuration file and do all those tasks for me.  Grunt, Gulp and Webpack can help you automating these processes and Webpack has become the one tool that rules them all.  

But Grunt and Gulp are task managers!  Yeah, that's true, but Webpack can do that too, and it is easier than Gulp (I love Gulp though)

## How do you start using Webpack for your projects?

I'll start with a very basic project, then we'll try a more complex one, though it won't be very complex.
